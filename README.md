# Overview


This project was made to help increase my knowledge / learn React and how to use a database, as I hadn't done either before now. I have created a web app that acts as a personal to-do list. The user can add and delete items from the list and it will stay populated when the page is left. 

The program can be run by loading the files onto your machine and running `npm run dev` in the terminal.

Most recently, I added user authentication, so now instead of one to-do list that anyone can edit, there is a google sign in and it is specific to the users email.

# Web Pages

There is only one page for this web app. It dynamically allows a user to add and delete items from a to-do list. 


# Development Environment

For this project, I used Next.js to access the react framework. The entire program is written in react and uses a database from firebase firestore. The user authentication is also provided for by firebase.
